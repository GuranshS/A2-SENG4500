To run the connect 4 program simply open the directory containing the main file in 2 separate terminals and use the following command in both terminals:

'''python main.py'''

The program will by default use the Broadcast address  "255.255.255.255" and Broadcast port "5000"

If you want to specify the address and port it can be fed as a command line argument like this:

'''python main.py <Address> <Port>'''

For example:

'''python main.py 255.255.255.255 4700'''
